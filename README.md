Libraries for my programming projects related to HACAL.

You'll need these for most, if not all of my HACAL programs.

Run as root to install:

```
make clean all install
```

Run as root to uninstall:

```
make clean uninstall
```

Or run this as root, if you want to keep the build folder for some reason:

```
make uninstall
```
